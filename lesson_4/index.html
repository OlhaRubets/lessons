            <h2 id="bigraphy">Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Born in 1961 in Trenton, New Jersey to Philander and Shirley Rodman. Philander was in the US Air Force and later fought in Vietnam. When Dennis was a child, his father left the family and moved to the Philippines. Rodman has many siblings — according to his father, he has 26 or 28 siblings in his line. However, Rodman himself stated that he is the oldest of 47 children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodman, along with two sisters, Debra and Kim, grew up in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas, one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city at the time.[8][9] The mother gave her son the nickname "Worm" because of the way he moved while playing pinball[10]. According to Rodman, his mother was more interested in his two sisters, both of whom were considered more talented than he was at basketball, and often mocked him. Debra and Kim eventually became All-American athletes at their respective universities. Debra won two US collegiate titles as part of her team.

                While studying at school, Rodman was not considered a promising athlete. According to him, he "couldn't even make a layup." Was enrolled in the school's basketball teams, but spent most of his time on the bench or out of the lineup. At the beginning of high school, he was only 1.68 cm tall. He also did not make the football team and was "completely devastated".

            <h3>Early years</h3>
            <p>After graduation, he worked as a night shift cleaner at the Dallas airport. It was at this time that he suddenly grew from 180 cm to 201 cm and decided to try playing basketball again. With the help of a family friend, he was able to get into North Central Texas College (1983), and then transferred to Southeastern Oklahoma State University (1983-1986). The teams of both institutions played in the lower leagues of the NCAA. However, he managed to prove himself and submit his candidacy for the NBA draft.   
            </p>
            <h3>Detroit Pistons</h3>
            <p>In 1986, he was selected in the second round of the NBA draft with the 27th overall pick by the Detroit Pistons. At that time, the team, which was called "Bad Boys", was coached by Chuck Daly and featured such players as Isaiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, Adrian Dantley, Sidney Green and Bill Laimbeer. However, among such company, playing time was found for Rodman, who managed to score 6.5 points and 4.7 rebounds per game in 15 minutes on the court in the first season. The Washington Bullets, and later the Atlanta Hawks, helped the team easily pass through the playoffs. However, Detroit lost to Boston in the Eastern Conference finals. After the losing streak, Rodman made headlines after saying that Larry Bird was an overrated player: “Larry Bird is overrated in a lot of ways. Why does he get so much attention? Because he is white. You will never hear that the black player is the greatest.'' After that, he received a barrage of criticism, but he managed to avoid accusations of racism thanks to the fact that he was dating a white girl.</p>
            <p>The following season, 1987-1988, he improved his statistics to 11.6 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and helped the Pistons reach the NBA Finals, where they defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in a difficult seven-game series. Rodman continued to be a reserve player the following season, but continued to improve his defensive play, earning him a first-team All-Star selection for the first of eight times in his career. In the playoffs, "Detroit" beat "Boston" and "Chicago", in which the most productive player of the league, Michael Jordan, played. In the NBA Finals, the Pistons met the Lakers again and easily beat them in a four-game series. Despite back spasms, Rodman dominated the boards in the Finals series and became the NBA champion for the first time.</p>
            <h3>San Antonio Spurs</h3>
            <p>
                In October 1993, he joined the San Antonio Spurs, a team built around star David Robinson. The team also featured such players as Dale Ellis, Willie Anderson and Vinny del Negro. Already at the beginning of the season, Rodman began to show the first signs of a new guy who killed the "modest" guy in him - he dyed his hair like the main character of the movie "Destroyer". However, this did not stop him from showing a good game - he once again became the league leader in the number of rebounds per game, collecting 17.6 rebounds per game. Also during this period, clashed on the court with Stacey King and John Stockton, refused to leave the court after being ejected and had a two-month affair with Madonna. The only person he respected on the team was Jack Haley, as he was the only one who wasn't shocked by Rodman's visit to the gay bar. Despite 55 wins in the regular season, the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Utah Jazz.
            </p>
            <h3>Recent years in the NBA</h3>
            <p>
                The next team in the player's career was the Los Angeles Lakers, which he joined in January 1999 before the start of the lockout-shortened season. Played 23 matches for the new team and was excluded from its team. In the 1999-2000 season, he signed a contract with the Dallas Mavericks. He played 12 games for the team from Dallas, during which he managed to collect six technical fouls, be ejected twice and receive a one-game suspension. At the same time, his playing skills were at a good level, which allowed him to make 14.3 rebounds per game.
            </p>
            <h3>Career outside the NBA</h3>
            <p>
                After "Dallas" he retired from basketball for a while, devoting time to a career in movies and wrestling. In 2003, he signed a contract with the ABA team "Long Beach Jam", as part of which he spent one season. As part of it, he became the ABA champion. In the future, he also managed to play for the Mexican "Fuersa Regia" (2004), "Orange County Crush" from the ABA (2004-2005)[37], the Mexican "Tijuana Dragons" (2005-2006), the Finnish "Torpan Poyat" (one match in 2005). The last team in the player's career was Brighton Bears from Great Britain, for which he played three matches in 2006. On April 4, 2011, it was announced that Rodman would be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.
